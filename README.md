# Web-Programming-CW2022

Design your own webpage (must start from wedding.php) to find suitable wedding venue(s) based on
date, party size and catering grade provided by users.

A basic solution to this task would potentially obtain up to 40%. You can be creative of the webpage
design and show the venue results informatively to users. The results should include the venue name,
capacity, licensed, catering cost per person, price of week/weekend day, total price, the number of times
that the venue had been booked before (to show the user how much the venue is popular), and the day of
week (Monday, Tuesday, â€¦) for the selected date. To make your webpage faster and more interactive,
you need to consider using AJAX and JSON (15% available for effective use of AJAX and JSON). To
make your solution more flexible, you could allow the user to enter a range of dates, rather than just a
single date and present them with several possibilities. You may assume that the range of dates cover no
more than a one-week period (10% available for implementing this functionality).
